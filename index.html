    <h1>About Me: 8-Bit Modern</h1>
  </header>

  <div style="text-align: justify; width: 80%; left: 10%; position: relative;">
    <p>Hello, I'm 8bitmodern, a YouTuber hailing from the beautiful state of Iowa. I'm passionate about technology and have a knack for unraveling the mysteries of how things work. In 2023, I proudly graduated from college with a degree in Network Administration and Security.</p>

    <p>Since February 2022, I've been on an exciting journey into the world of Japanese language and culture. Learning a new language has opened up a world of opportunities and connections for me.</p>

    <p>When you start to recognize more of the world you can make deep connections with people, even if they are not of your target language.</p>

    <p>When I'm not diving into the intricacies of network security or exploring the depths of the Japanese language, you'll find me indulging my creative side. I love digital design and enjoy creating unique t-shirt designs and fan-made albums. It's a way for me to combine my tech skills with my artistic flair.</p>

    <p>Speaking of music, my favorite artists are Twenty One Pilots and Juice WRLD. Their music resonates with me on a deep level and inspires much of my creative work. Even if both artists deal with differing struggles, the one thing that is common is fear, pain. Listening to these artists make me feel not so alone.</p>

    <p>Now, let's talk about my gaming side. Minecraft is my virtual playground, and one of my proudest creations is a replica of the Doctor Who TARDIS. It's a testament to my love for both technology and pop culture.</p>

    <p>During my college days, I forged valuable friendships. I met Glen, a SoundCloud rapper, whose music I've always been a fan of. Our collaboration has been a creative adventure.</p>

    <p>However, my most significant contribution has been to my friend Jayson, known as Lonelynite. I have Embarked on various fan projects related to his music.</p>

    <p>Beyond my digital adventures, I'm fortunate to have made friends from South Korea. I have big plans to visit them one day. In July 2023, we even went on an unforgettable trip to Yellowstone, creating memories that will last a lifetime.</p>

    <p>Lastly, I've had the pleasure of working with Twitch streamers, such as Visual Hot Sauce, to bring exciting content to their viewers.</p>

    <p>Join me on my journey as I continue to explore technology, culture, and creativity. Even if I am not active or I lose my grip I hope you can find something interesting here.</p>
